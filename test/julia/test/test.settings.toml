[hamiltonian]
  # Contains the following booleans:
  #   breit, nms, sms, qed_vp
  # Each indicates if the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian
  # was enabled. If it is omitted, it is assumed to have been off.
  #
  # May also contain qed_se (string), which indicates that a particular
  # QED self-energy operator was also included in the Hamiltonian.
  # The possible values are: 'hydrogenic', 'qedmod', 'flambaum' and 'pyykkoe'
  #
  # Finally, for the hydrogenic QED self-energy, qed_se_hydrogenic_cutoff
  # (integer) may be defined, which sets the n-quantum number cutoff. If not
  # present, the implementation default is used.
