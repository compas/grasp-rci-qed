  # Contains the following booleans:

  # Each indicates if the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian
  # was enabled. If it is omitted, it is assumed to have been off.
  #
  # Can also contain breit (string) which indicates the mode of the
  # transverse photon operator. Possible values are 'breit', 'specorbs'
  # and 'full'. If set to 'n', the operator is completely disabled.
  #
  # May also contain qed_se (string), which indicates that a particular
  # QED self-energy operator was also included in the Hamiltonian.
  # The possible values are: 'hydrogenic', 'qedmod', 'flambaum' and 'pyykkoe'
  #
  # Finally, for the hydrogenic QED self-energy, qed_se_hydrogenic_cutoff
  # (integer) may be defined, which sets the n-quantum number cutoff. If not
  # present, the implementation default is used.
