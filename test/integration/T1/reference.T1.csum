 To H (Dirac Coulomb) is added
  H (Transverse) --- factor multiplying the photon frequency:  1.00000000D-06;
  H (Vacuum Polarisation);
  H (Normal Mass Shift);
  H (Specific Mass Shift);
  the total will be diagonalised.
 Diagonal contributions from H (Self Energy) will be estimated
  from a screened hydrogenic approximation.

Radial grid: R(I) = RNT*(exp((I-1)*H)-1), I = 1, ..., N;
